# Vaporize

Vaporize is a small tool built around Vapor's `Console` framework that is heavily inspired by Vapor's `toolbox`. Right now, the executable will generate a new project for you using my Vapor Template (https://github.com/mcdappdev/Vapor-Template), ask you for some MySQL/Redis information, and then generate a clean project for you using those specifications.

# Requirements

You must have Swift installed, as well as the Vapor toolbox.

# Installation

You can run the following code in your terminal to download Vaporize:

`curl -sL 162llc.com/install.sh | bash`

# Thanks

Much thanks to the Vapor team as well as everyone who helped contribute to the template as well as the creation of this tool.
